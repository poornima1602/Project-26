• In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda; set aside.
• In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter
with both sugars; beat on medium speed until light and fluffy.
• Reduce speed to low; add salt, vanilla, eggs.
• Beat until well mixed, about 1 minute.

• Drop heaping tablespoons-size balls of dough about 2 inches apart on baking sheets lined
with parchment paper.
• Bake until cookies are golden around the edges, but still soft in the center, 8 to 10
minutes. Remove from oven, and let cool on baking sheet 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a
wire rack, and let cool completely. Store cookies in an airtight container at room
temperature up to 1 week.
